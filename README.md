# spelling-errors-GA
The following is a list of spelling errors that were searched in major online English-Irish and Irish-English dictionaries.

This version of the list is not yet exhaustive of the data available. This list will be updated at least bi-annually, if not quarterly.

All list items are included because they have been searched on at least ten different occasions per quarter.

Some multiword items contain correct spellings that should not be seperated from the incorrectly spelled word. The entire unit was searched and satisfied the frequency condition above.

I recommend treating this list as you treat a stoplist. It is a special purpose list which is used internally to mark frequent offenders in Analytics reports.
